# Nexus OS
Nexus OS is a custom operating system based on Ubuntu, one of the most popular Linux distributions. It’s built for 64-bit systems only, meaning it’s designed to run on modern computers that support 64-bit architecture — allowing it to use more memory, run faster, and handle newer applications better than 32-bit systems.

Since it’s based on Ubuntu, Nexus OS has access to the massive Ubuntu software ecosystem, regular security updates, and excellent hardware compatibility. However, it adds its own unique features, like a customized desktop interface it has different branding, and the same tools as Ubuntu that make it easier for users switching from Windows.

# THIS OS IS MADE BY A SINGLE PERSON SO EXPECT BUGS
The Nexus Foundation is not responseable for any damage by Ubuntu OS which Nexus is based off of.
